        <h1>Pump1</h1>
        <p>We are live protesting outside the White House every day</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <p>We didn't just create Pump1 - we took to the streets. Every single day, we showed up outside the White House with one mission.</p>
        
        <p>Our demands: Launch a USD1 coin for Pump, or get Trump to cosign us. We weren't leaving until one of those happened.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            Daily protests outside the White House until Trump cosigns Pump1
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Protest</h2>
        
        <div>
            <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Started protesting outside the White House with Pump1 signs and banners</p>
            
            <p><strong>Every Day After:</strong> Showed up rain or shine, demanding they launch USD1 for Pump</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Message:</strong> "Launch USD1 for Pump or Trump cosign us - we're not going anywhere"</p>
            
            <p><strong>Still Going:</strong> The protest continues until we get what we came for</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why We Protest</h2>
        
        <p>Pump1 deserves recognition at the highest level. We believe in this project so much that we're willing to stand outside the White House every single day.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't about hype or trends - it's about persistence, dedication, and proving that a community can make noise loud enough to reach the President himself.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Demands</h2>
        
        <p>We have two clear demands, and we'll accept either one:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The White House launches a USD1 stablecoin specifically for Pump. We want official government backing for Pump1.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Trump publicly cosigns Pump1. A tweet, a mention, an endorsement - any acknowledgment from Trump himself.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Until Then:</strong> We're outside the White House every single day. This is our full-time job until one of these happens.</p>
        
        <h2>The Daily Routine</h2>
        
        <p>Every morning, we arrive at the White House gates. Signs up, voices loud, message clear: "USD1 for Pump or Trump cosign us."</p>
        
        <p>We've made ourselves impossible to ignore. Security knows us by name. Staff members see us every day. The message is getting through.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't a one-time stunt - this is sustained pressure. Day after day after day, we're there. And we won't stop.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            Pump1: Protesting daily until Trump cosigns or USD1 launches
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Movement</h2>
        
        <p>What started as a crypto project has become a protest movement. We're showing the world what real commitment looks like.</p>
        
        <p>No other meme coin has ever done this. No other community has camped outside the White House demanding presidential recognition. We're making history.</p>
        
        <p>Either Trump will cosign us, or they'll launch USD1 for Pump. One way or another, Pump1 will get the recognition it deserves.</p>
